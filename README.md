# tpapi
A Python client library for the Target Process Rest API. Mostly a simple object mapper for entity data
and takes care of the http requests for you. Entities are returned as Python Objects which can be extended via
subclassing.

Currently there is support for querying data and creating simple entities without other entity references, with more 
to come shortly.
